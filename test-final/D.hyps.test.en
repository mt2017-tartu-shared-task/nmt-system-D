Language, literature, art, imaginary art, architecture, craft, cinema and broadcasting are all part of the cultural diversity of Europe.
The European Union has two objectives: Maintaining and supporting diversity and making it available to others.
EU cultural industries – cinematographic and audiovisual industry, publishing, music industry and crafts – are all important sources of income and job providers, employing around seven million people.
The Union has economic responsibility for this area and seeks to ensure the right conditions for the European industry to be competitive at international level.
Therefore, the EU has initiated programmes encouraging them to exploit the opportunities offered by the single market and digital technologies.
The EU also seeks to create a dynamic environment for these industries, facilitating access to finance, contributing to research projects and encouraging cooperation with the internal and external partners of the Union.
The Union will also involve the cultural dimension in many of its other policies, such as education (including language learning), research, support for new technologies and information society and social and regional development.
For example, the European Social Fund will be supported by the Italian Arturo Toscanini Foundation, which has organised courses for unemployed musicians since mid-1990s.
The specific objectives of the current cultural programme are to promote awareness at European level of key cultural objects and to promote their retention; promote mobility between the workers of the cultural sector; encourage the transnational circulation of works and cultural and artistic works;
& quot; Media & quot; programmes aimed at making Europe more dynamic and competitive have worked since the mid-1990s.
Each year, one of the two cities will be selected as a European Capital of Culture and gives them the right to receive financial support.
Linguistic diversity is the cornerstone of the European Union's culture and democracy.
Language not only opens the door to other cultures, but also gives us the opportunity to get part of cultural contacts when travelling to other countries.
It is estimated that 40 million people in the EU speak language as language, which is not their country of origin.
The CAP aims to ensure a reasonable standard of living for farmers, to provide consumers with a fair price at a fair price and to preserve our land heritage.
The remaining bovine meat and gymnastics and milk lakes are already twenty years since the first wave of reforms.
Our main source of information and entertainment is television.
Each of us is on average three hours a day of news, sports transfers, films and other shows.
The government of each Member State has its own audiovisual policy, while the Union establishes rules and guidelines for common interests, such as the EU and open borders and fair competition.
In order to protect and promote their cultural diversity, the EU's World Trade Organisation (WTO) requested a so-called cultural derogation which was successful.
Due to the speed of technological innovation, broadcasting and telecommunications have approached each other.
Open borders and affordable transport have given Europeans a personal freedom of movement so far.
Goods are transported quickly and efficiently from the factory to consumers who are often in different countries.
The European Union has contributed by opening the internal market to competition and removing natural and technical barriers to mobility.
However, the current transport models and the pace of growth are unsustainable.
The rapid, efficient and cheap transport capacity of people and goods is the guiding principle of the EU's dynamic economy and a coherent society.
Removing barriers to cross-border trade and travel has increased the volume of long-distance transport of goods and passengers.
Although many aspects of transport policy fall within the scope of the Member States, it is reasonable for the European common market to be a single transport infrastructure.
Over the last ten years, the EU has opened national transport markets for competition across the Union, in particular the road and air transport sector and the less railway sector.
As a result, lorries can also be taken apart in other countries, so that they do not return to international voyages.
Road transport is now transported by 44% of all goods in the EU, with 39% transported short sea routes, 10% railways and 34% of inland waterways.
The transfer of freight and passenger transport to road transport modes of less polluting transport is a key factor in any sustainable transport policy.
The European Union (EU) is a family of democratic European countries that are committed to cooperation for peace and prosperity.
The EU is not a country that should replace existing countries, and not an organisation of international cooperation.
Europpa will go back to the Second World War.
The idea was therefore that Europeans have decided to avoid repetition of such killing and destruction.
Six countries, mainly in the area of trade and economy, cooperated in the beginning.
Now the 27 countries of the EU and 490 million people are involved, and it deals with many issues that are directly important for our everyday lives.
Europe is a continent of many traditions and languages, but it also has common values, such as democracy, freedom and social justice.
In the world of 21st century, where countries are increasingly dependent on each other, there is more ever more need for every European citizen to engage with people in other countries, in a spirit of openness, openness and solidarity.
You can travel through a larger part of the EU without passport and without stopping you.
The EU's story as a ten step from Schuman Declaration and six Member States in the 1950s to the 2007 enlargement and 27 Member States.
On 9 May 1950, the Schuman Declaration was proposed to establish a European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was a link to the Paris Agreement of 18 April 1951.
Customs duties on six countries were abolished entirely on 1 July 1968 and common policies were introduced in 1960, in particular trade and agricultural policy.
In June 1979 a decisive step was made for the European Community, because the first direct and general elections in the European Parliament took place.
The European political shape became a major change in the Berlin Wall in 1989.
In March 2000 the EU adopted the Lisbon Strategy for the modernisation of the European economy and to enable it to compete with other key players in the world market such as the US and the new industrialised countries.
The Ränder has so much to discover and the European Union has made it much easier.
You can cross the EU without controlling many borders and the euro makes it easier to buy.
The Green Card is not mandatory for travel in the EU, but it is an internationally recognised insurance certificate and facilitates the satisfaction of the requirements of accidents.
The creation of a single European market in air transport has meant lower fares and a wider choice of air carriers and services to passengers.
There are 210 000 km of railways in the EU, offering various international passenger services.
In several countries, high-speed rail lines have a speed of up to 300 km / h and this year is extended to new connections in Belgium, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, France, Germany and the UK.
Latvia on the Baltic Sea is a low land with large forests from which wood and paper industries are stored.
It is also produced in Latvia and textiles and working surfaces.
Ethnically, the population comprises 59% of the threshold and 29% of the Russians and more than one third of the population live in Riga.
Riiga is the largest city in the Baltic States, the inhabitants are 730 000.
The Commission shall be elected by direct universal suffrage every four years.
The President shall elect Parliament as well as every four years.
The Latvian vegetables are a bacon pie and a cold refreshing milk soup.

The seminar will assess the number of multilingual lexions intended for very different applications: Translation of the interpretation of the translation project up to large machine-readable glossaries and databases.
International thermonuclear nuclear reactor, an important test facility designed to demonstrate that nuclear fusion energy production is scientifically and technically feasible.
Research and innovation help create jobs, improve prosperity and quality of life.
After successful trials in recent years, research into fusion energy research and development has reached a point where effective progress towards sustainable energy production is expected.
& quot; Knowledge is a key factor in competitiveness, & quot; European Research Commissioner Janez Potočnik.
If our companies have to play a leading role in the future, they must invest in knowledge now and the governments must take appropriate measures to assist them.
The EU is part of a globalised world where knowledge is more evenly distributed than ever.
Fusion is the opportunity to produce almost unlimited amounts of clean energy over a long time.
The low level of research and development expenditure in the private sector in Europe is mainly due to differences in industrial structure and that the European high tech industry is lower.
As far as science is concerned, although the EU is the world's largest creator of scientific knowledge, the impact of European science is less than US science.
Europe is the influence of quotes on indicators and the number of green quotes from the USA in all disciplines.
The EU universities are also very under-represented at the forefront of the ranking of the largest university in the world's largest universities.
In addition, communication technology (patented inventions) and the research base in the EU are much weaker than the US.
Europe has a difficult breakthrough in the new high-tech industry.
Today, the new discovery of R & amp; D funding started when the European Commission adopted proposals to launch the first European public-private partnership for research and development.
In order to ensure our competitiveness and prosperity, Europe needs a new approach to science in certain promising areas.
This is the area where the public, European and industrial funding of research provides much less added value, creating favourable assumptions for research and development funding by private sector.
Invisible computers (embedded computing systems) are today running all machines from cars, aircraft and phones, from energy networks and works to washing machines and televisions.
It is predicted that over 16 billion embedded systems are available by 2010 and over 40 billion devices worldwide will exist by 2020.
By 2010, these invisible chips account for 30-40% of the value of new products in consumer electronics (41%), telecommunications (37%), car (36%) and medical devices (33%).
The Innovative Medicines Initiative supports the development of new knowledge, equipment and methods to enable faster and safer use of medicines.
The European Commission is currently presenting its ideas on the European Research Area, which represents most of the potential of Europe's knowledge.
The Commission aims to mobilise this potential, enabling people, infrastructures, organisations, sources of funding, knowledge exchange and global cooperation to operate effectively.
More efficient knowledge and use of knowledge is essential if the EU wants to achieve its economic, social and social objectives, listed in the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs.
Our future depends on whether Europe can become a truly knowledge-based society.
The European Research Area is a basis for which this knowledge-based society must be built.
Businesses have difficulty creating partnerships with universities, especially universities in other countries.
Researchers will continue to encounter obstacles to career development or elsewhere in the EU.
The national and regional funding of research is largely uncoordinated and therefore ineffective.
The use of research results could be significantly improved.
The document is accompanied by guidelines helping research institutions to improve links with industry, highlighting good practice in the management and exchange of knowledge and intellectual property.
Sufficient competent researchers who are highly mobile between institutions, disciplines, sectors and countries are one of the main axes.
The aim of the directive is to achieve a good level of quality of river waters, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and groundwater in the European Union by 2015.
Sustainable water management is vital for protecting biodiversity, the well-being of citizens and the competitiveness of European industries.
Participating partners will benefit from greater visibility, research and development capacity, better financial incentives and reduced risk-related costs.
Businesses will be involved directly in research and education, thereby contributing to supporting entrepreneurial mindsets and researchers.
The European Commission has now taken a position on how to modernise European universities best.
European universities have enormous potential, a large part of which is unfortunately not used because of rigidity and various obstacles.
The release of large knowledge, talent and energy supplies requires immediate, thorough and coordinated change: As from the way in which systems are regulated and managed, up to the methods of governance of universities.
Although universities are training and teaching millions of people every year, there are still many obstacles in European higher education systems, many of which are decades old.
Universities are a driving force for knowledge creation.
Universities need to adapt to the demands of global, knowledge-based economy, the same as to adapt to other sectors of society and the economy.
Each institution should find a balance between education, research and innovation that is suited to its role in the region or in the country best.
The aim is to create a framework whereby schools can become more powerful players in a global knowledge-based society and economy.
The Commission is ready to support the modernisation of EU universities through the process of identifying and sharing good practices and through their education, research and innovation funding programmes.
The European Commission has clarified nine areas where changes should be made so that European universities can contribute to the creation of a genuine knowledge-based economy.
One of the proposals is to allow students to use national loans and grants everywhere in the EU where they decide to learn or do science.
We need to change national tuition and support schemes so that the best students can participate in higher education and continue their research careers regardless of their background.
We need to change the funding systems of universities in order to focus more on the outcome and allow universities more responsibility for their own long-term finances, particularly in research.
We need to allow universities more autonomy and responsibility to respond quickly to changes.
This could include a review of curricula to adapt them to new developments, the introduction of closer relations between research areas and focus on specific research areas instead of specific research areas (e.g. renewable energy, nanotechnology).
It may also include greater autonomy at the choice of a specific institution at the level of teaching and research staff.
In all EU Member States, seat belts must now be fastened in all vehicles, including buses and microbuses.
Observe that Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom are driving on the left side and remember that in some countries such as Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Portugal, you will normally have to give the road to the right vehicles.
The use of mobile phones while driving is significantly increasing the risk of life-threatening accidents and is either directly or indirectly prohibited in all EU Member States.
Although a maximum of 0.5 mg / ml is permitted in most EU Member States, the other ranges from 0.2 mg / ml to 0.8 mg / ml (0,9 mg / ml in Cyprus) and in some countries in the blood, the blood should not be administered at all.
When travelling in the EU, the insurance policy of the vehicle automatically provides the minimum required insurance protection (road insurance).
Speed limitation is generally 110, 120 or 130 km / h, and it is 50 or sometimes 60 km / h.
As a passenger, you have a number of rights in the case of flight and reservation information, luggage damage, delays and flights, not on board accidents, accidents or passengers.
These rights apply both to domestic and international routes and for international and international flights from one EU airport or outside EU airport flying to EU air carriers.
New rules have been introduced on liquids that passengers can carry out in cabin baggage checkpoints.
Liquids (including cream, gel, toothpaste, nozzles, perfumes) must be individually equipped with maximum volume of 100 ml.
Passengers shall be allowed to take liquids purchased from the aerodrome, such as beverages or perfumes.

In view of the change in society, social progress and scientific and technological progress, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights by bringing them clearer in the Charter.
These rights are accompanied by responsibility and responsibilities for other people, human society and future generations.
The right to marry and the right to establish a family shall be provided in accordance with national legislation governing the exercise of these rights.
Everyone has the right to accumulate peacefully and form associations at all levels, in particular in the area of politics, trade unions and civil society; this involves the right of everyone to defend their interests and to engage in them.
The Union is a common institutional framework to ensure that its objectives are consistent and continuity, while respecting and developing the acquis communautaire.
The European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court and the Court of Auditors shall exercise its powers in accordance with those conditions and objectives provided for on the one hand by the Treaties establishing the European Communities and the provisions of the Treaties and of the other provisions of this Agreement.
The Union is founded on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, which is common to all Member States.

The Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom Treaty) was signed in Rome on 25 March 1957 and entered into force on 1 January 1958.
The objective of the Euratom Treaty was to coordinate programmes for the peaceful use of nuclear energy already underway or in Member States.
This agreement has now been transposed into the EC Treaty.
Accession treaties shall contain conditions laid down for the accession of new countries to the European Union and the necessary adaptations to the Treaties on the basis of the Treaties.
The Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC Treaty) is the oldest Treaty establishing the European Community, and was signed in Paris on 23 July 1952 and expired on 23 July 2002, as it was 50 years.
The purpose of the agreement was to establish a common coal and steel market and the same scheme was gradually extended to other economic sectors.
The normal procedure for the EC Treaty is now applied to the coal and steel sector.
Such agreements shall always be concluded between the subjects of international law (Member States or organisations) with a view to initiating international cooperation.
International agreements are the second source of EU legislation that enables the European Union to develop economic, social and political relations with the rest of the world.

Cooperation agreements are not as comprehensive as Association Agreements, since only close economic cooperation is concerned.
Trade agreements shall be agreements concluded with the group of non-Union countries or countries outside the Union or within the framework of international trade organisations.
Agreements between Member States are binding on the Member States either to address issues which are closely linked to Community activities, but for which the powers of the Community institutions have not been conferred on the Community institutions or to extend the boundaries of national provisions in order to create a uniform instrument (e.g. Community patent agreement).
Secondary legislation is a third largest source of Community legislation following the Treaties (primary legislation) and international agreements.
Secondary legislation includes binding legislation under the EC Treaty (regulations, directives and decisions) and non-binding acts (resolutions, opinions) together with a whole range of other acts such as internal rules and Community action programmes.
The legislation relating to the second and third pillars, which is actually not part of secondary legislation, is subject to a proper documentation in this category.
A Regulation adopted jointly or exclusively by the Council and the European Parliament shall be the main measure which is binding on all parts of the Commission.
Unlike directives aimed at Member States, and decisions aimed at specific beneficiaries, regulations are aimed at all.
The Regulation is directly applicable, which means that it will be established without delay in all Member States, as well as national legislation without national authorities in addition to anything.
The consolidation consists of the inclusion of the basic act (the Treaty or any of the Community acts) and subsequent amendments and improvements to one text which is not formally authentic.
The Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance shall issue decisions of the Court of First Instance or the Court of First Instance.
