the purpose of this report is to describe the steps to be taken to build 
a staff management function ‚Äì to clarify the PH strategy and operations 
. there is currently no PH-function on the investment department . the 
idea of this report was set up in the debate on the EUPCU leader Dace 
Roz . the content of the PH-plan was also discussed with the heads of 
other entities : Anita Bisofa , Valda Ceputers and Valdis Bisters . the 
investment department of Moe is growing rapidly and is facing many 
changes over the coming years . possible changes in the department 
&apos;s organisation are already in consideration . pressure to address 
effectively and correctly both processes and personnel issues is 
pressing . in the current situation , directors and directors of units 
are so busy with the projects to develop a coincidence . it is highly 
desirable to appoint a person responsible for PH , who can concentrate 
on setting up a system of staff management and will be able to develop 
it in accordance with practical needs . the department &apos;s vision 
and mission must be clear before planning for the INT section . the 
Investment Department strategy and the short-term action plan are 
recommended for a yearly review . the EU , but also national programmes 
, should be stressed in accordance with the real need . the number of 
projects is increasing considerably and more projects will reach the 
implementation phase , which affects the number of workers needed and 
their areas of competence . the PRK ( Project Handbook on Project 
Implementation ) and PKJ will soon be prepared . they should be used in 
this autumn . the PRK shall take into account the requirements of each 
financing method and describe the appropriate sub-processes . these 
instructions provide practical indications for both the flow of work and 
the organisation . these instructions should serve as a basis for the 
following steps such as writing and identifying the areas of competence 
. the necessary measures for the establishment and future practical 
needs of the staff management system are described in Annex III . the 
initial plan for the establishment of the PHC system is set out in Annex 
IV . the plan would be a prerequisite for the staff manager / 
coordinator to start full-time work on a PH development in early 
December 2003 . the Director of the Department and the Heads of Unit 
should cooperate closely with the staff management staff , to inform him 
of the need for continuous development and prioritise it . they are also 
responsible for the development assessment and the discussion of the 
Scoreboard ; staff management staff will contribute to the modernisation 
and storage of malformations . the Heads of Unit must play an active 
role in developing themes and content of competences . the 
self-assessment of competences involves all staff . the staff management 
officer shall coordinate the assessment of competences and manage data 
files . the budget for the 2004 budget in the draft budget must include 
both the costs of PH development ( mainly PH-employee , staff managers , 
IT staff salaries ) as well as training costs for training . 
implementation costs consist of direct costs ( e.g. courses , lecturers 
, materials ) , teaching and training times from time to time , working 
time of training participants and training and facilitating training and 
facilitation by PH-employee . once a year , due to lost working time , 
the cost is also incurred and the PLP interviews . prior to the 
provision of any budget figures , an indicative evaluation of the 2004 
training activities must be provided . this Act regulates the energy 
industry as an economic infrastructure that involves the acquisition and 
use of energy resources and the production , purchase , conversion , 
storage , transfer , transfer and supply of energy for energy consumers 
and the consumption of energy resources , but also to be provided with 
the transfer procedures of the energy industry and the organisational 
principles and developments in energy supply traders . energy policy is 
part of the national economic policy and the national energy programme 
of Latvia has to define its implementation strategy , which will be 
developed for 15 years and needs to be improved regularly ‚Äì every five 
years ‚Äì based on research and international factors affecting energy 
supply and energy supply . ( 1 ) Energy supply traders are regulated 
traders which , in accordance with the requirements of the licence , 
have to ensure safe , continuous and stable electricity , heating , gas 
or other types of energy and fuel supply , in accordance with the law of 
the public utility regulators , shall be regulated in accordance with 
the law of utilities of utilities . ( 1 ) In the area of activity 
provided for in the licence and within the period specified in the

the sites for storage of natural gas , where such access is consistently 
consistent with the relevant technical rules and safety requirements . ( 
2 ) The specific obligations of the system operator must be maintained 
in the event of a change in the company ‚Äô s shareholder ( interest group 
) or the form or restructuring of the business , or if the need arises 
for a new licence . ( 3 ) An energy supply trader supplying energy to 
users , sells them with the necessary or defined quality and quantities 
required by the regulator with the regulated tariff or tariffs

with technical rules , regulatory requirements imposed by regulators and 
the quality of the contract and the continuous operation of their items 
as well as their technical status . ( 2 ) Energy users shall ensure that 
they are owned , held or used by existing networks and the technical 
service and maintenance of energy use equipment and equipment . once a 
year , energy supply traders shall report to the regulator on the 
activities carried out and planned and provide the regulator with 
information in accordance with the law of the utilities regulatory 
authorities . the restructuring operations of traders with energy supply 
and the termination of their activities shall be written by law of the 
regulatory authorities . ( 1 ) In order to ensure the purchase , 
production , transfer , distribution and marketing of energy , energy 
supply traders may operate horizontally or vertically integrated or 
individually , by obtaining a licence for each type of energy supply . ( 
2 ) In a horizontal or vertically integrated energy supply traders shall 
draw up a separate balance sheet for each type of energy supplied in the 
accounts and a statement of profit and cash flows , as would be dealt 
with differently by the trader in each type of energy supply . ( 3 ) In 
accordance with the procedures laid down in paragraph 2 of this Title , 
the trader shall submit the balance sheet and the profit and cash cash 
statement to the regulator at the latest one month after the annual 
report on the annual accounts of companies . ( 4 ) The regulator shall 
define procedures by which the trader ensures public access to the 
balance sheet drawn up in accordance with the procedures laid down in 
paragraph 2 of this Title and the profit and cash flows and other 
financial information . ( 1 ) Energy supply traders may operate a system 
of transmission system , distribution system or central heating 
equipment . ( 2 ) In order to ensure the safe and effective operation of 
the system , traders with energy supply shall exchange the necessary 
information and ensure the protection of business secrets at the same

distribution items or objects of natural gas storage shall select the 
relevant transmission or distribution system or operators of natural gas 
storage systems , which may be set up by the trader of a single natural 
gas transmission , distribution and storage system . ( 11 ) The system 
operator refers to the tariffs or tariffs imposed on transmission , 
distribution and natural gas by the regulator designated by the operator 
in accordance with the regulatory tariff calculation method established 
by the regulator in accordance with the procedures established by the 
regulator , prior to their entry into force . ( 2 ) System operators

shall be communicated in writing within 30 days of the system operator 
&apos;s request for the necessary information from users or applicants 
for the development of operational rules . ( 6 ) The system operator is 
responsible for the operation , maintenance and security of energy 
transmission and distribution systems and natural gas storage sites , 
but also for the long-term capacity of the system to ensure the 
necessary demand for energy transmission or distribution or storage of 
natural gas . ( 7 ) The regulator shall approve the operational rules 
developed by the operator of the system or rules of use for storage of 
natural gas which are objective , economically justified , fair , equal 
, transparent and accessible to all users of the system , which require 
access to the system in question , by the operator of the system , and 
proposals for the regulation of the place of use of natural gas for the 
regulator within a specified time limit . in the wake of the energy 
supply crisis , the energy supply trader may start to use the quantity 
of fuel specified in the licence and with a type of fuel in order to 
ensure the continuous supply of energy to the energy user as far as 
possible . ( 1 ) Urban or rural council ( Council ) is established by 
the people of the municipality of the municipality and the people 
involved in the centre of the city , in the invitation of the President 
of the Council ( the Council ) , within four hours of the announcement 
of the local energy crisis . 2 ) If the energy crisis hits several 
municipalities , they will be able to coordinate the functioning of the 
energy centres of these local authorities or to set up a single local 
authority in which the people involved come together in accordance with 
a common agreement between the municipal and rural councils of the 
municipalities concerned ( fire councils ) , environmental protection 
professionals and representatives of energy supply traders . in view of 
the call of the March 2005 Council meeting , Latvia has prepared a 
national Lisbon programme for 2005-2008 ( hereinafter ‚Äò the programme ‚Äô 
) with a view to promoting national growth and employment . the 
programme is a policy planning document showing how Latvia will achieve 
the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in 2005 , following the integrated 
guidelines approved by the Council in July 2005 . the programme reflects 
the key challenges of the Lisbon Strategy to achieve the objectives of 
the Lisbon Strategy and identifies the main features of the actions and 
actions to address these challenges , but also indicators for achieving 
these objectives . the programme is based on the design documents for 
the Republic of Latvia . the programme was developed by the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs , the Ministry of Finance , the Ministry of Regional 
Development , the Ministry of Agriculture , the Ministry of Regional 
Development , the Ministry of Agriculture , Ministry of Agriculture , 
Ministry of Agriculture , Ministry of Agriculture , Ministry of 
Agriculture , Ministry of Agriculture , Ministry of Agriculture , 
Ministry of Agriculture , Ministry of Agriculture , Ministry of 
Agriculture and the Committee on Civil Services , the Ministry of 
Competition , the Ministry of Agriculture and the Committee on Civil 
Services , the Ministry of Competition the development of the programme 
was coordinated by the Lisbon Strategy Council . the consultation was 
held by the Sejm ( Latvian Parliament ) and the social partners . the 
programme consists of an introduction , a key element ( macroeconomic 
policy , microeconomic reforms , guidelines for employment policy ) and 
annexes . all figures and figures received from the Statistical Office 
of the Republic of Latvia or Eurostat , except in the cases specifically 
referred to . in order to successfully achieve these objectives , the 
ministries will be able to develop strategic plans with a view to 
preparing the 2007 budget , based on strategic planning principles , in 
line with the priorities set by the government in the medium-term 
development objectives and orientations , as well as all relevant 
ministries , and related programmes and sub-programmes , including their 
funding . to ensure Latvia &apos;s successful accession to the euro area 
, adopted the Cabinet of Ministers on 21 July 2005 in order to establish 
a European single currency in Latvia to develop the necessary measures 
to ensure the successful accession of Latvia to the euro area . on 31 
December 2004 , public debt amounted to 975 million tonnes , i.e. 13,3 % 
of GDP . public debt is expected to increase gradually in the coming 
years and may reach 13.6 % of GDP in 2008 . Latvia ‚Äô s sovereign debt is 
one of the lowest in the European Union , and it is expected that , 
within the medium term , the average debt criterion ( 60 % of GDP ) , as 
defined in the Maastricht Treaty , remains significantly below the 
country &apos;s gross debt . on the basis of the information provided , 
Latvia &apos;s current situation is not urgent to develop a specific 
plan to reduce public debt , but before any action is taken in the area 
of government debt management , the potential risks to the country 
should be carefully analysed . main proposed measures in the area of 
sovereign debt 2005-2008 ( Guideline 2 ) . to ensure the necessary 
resources to finance public deficit deficits and to refinance the 
sovereign debt commitments as low as possible and on the terms possible 
, by limiting financial risks and taking into account the development of 
the Latvian State capital market and all financial systems ( responsible 
authority : Ministry of Finance : Ministry of Finance ) : Äì to develop 
new debt repurchase and debt exchange programmes to manage debt 
refinancing risks in order to attract the opportunities offered by the 
capital market to attract long-term costs ; - In continuing to reduce 
the cost of public debt in the country , all existing provisions of 
external credit agreements will be reviewed in order to assess the 
future repayment of loans to be refinanced by loans other than loans to 
other favourable loans ‚Äì or existing limitations and limitations . the 
sustainability of public finances in Latvia can be assessed positively 
and is characterised by relatively small public debt , but also adequate 
budgetary discipline . Latvia ‚Äô s commitment to the Stability and Growth 
Pact , as well as in meeting the objective of the accession of the euro 
area , is another guarantee of positive trends in the current budgetary 
position . from a long-term perspective , the sustainability of public 
finances affects the sustainability of public finances , leading to a 
shrinking working-age population and their share of the population and 
increasing the demographic burden . the initial calculations of 
financial sustainability show that the ageing of the population is 
affecting the Latvian society and the economy and public finances , but 
thanks to the pension reform introduced , this impact does not result in 
an overdue impact . Latvia &apos;s small sovereign debt and pressure 
pressures will give the government some flexibility and maintain the 
stability of public finances . it should be noted , however , that an 
ageing population will test the health system in a new way . the 
breakdown of health costs according to age groups clearly shows that 
higher costs fall to older people whose numbers increase significantly 
over the next 50 years . long-term maintenance costs are currently 
relatively small in Latvia , due to the limited resources of both the 
government government and local authorities , but also of social 
traditions and values . at the same time , the health of other 
demographic groups must also be ensured , as the overall level of 
morbidity is high . the government will develop an efficient health 
system based on long-term perspectives . in order to adapt substantially 
to the current demographic situation , changes in national monetary 
policy will be needed . in view of the increase in the demographic 
burden in the longer term , growth in labour productivity growth is a 
key factor in improving the living standards of all population groups . 
it is therefore important to ensure the primary wealth of Latvia ‚Äì the 
training of people in accordance with labour market requirements in 
order to create an accessible labour market ( see section 3 ) . the 
forest , as it meets the requirements of wood processing , is also an 
important contribution to the overall development of the Latvian economy 
, as it meets the requirements of the wood processing industry . the 
forest is also an important resource for rural development , as it 
provides a livelihood for local people working in different areas , 
150,000 forest owners and forestry companies . part of the income 
generated by the final and harnessing harvest or services shall be 
invested by forest owner in preserving or maintaining the value of the 
forest . the largest forest owners ( country , local authorities and 
some private sector companies to which thousands of hectares of forest 
are owned by forest areas ) can ensure a continuous production process 
throughout the long run . taking into account the composition , age , 
structure , previous administrative practice of tree species , the 
economic situation of the rural area , but also the knowledge of forest 
owners , there is a considerable obstacle to forest production . due to 
the above circumstances , insufficient investment in the recovery of 
forest value is currently available ( revenue ) , therefore it is 
necessary to promote the productivity ( timely and high quality of the 
forest , the use of forest reproductive material in the forest , 
cultivation of young trees ) , particularly in private areas . although 
Latvia &apos;s waste management systems have been supplemented and 
society &apos;s awareness of the need to reduce waste has increased , 
the amount of waste generated is increasing every year . waste 
processing and disposal facilities are insufficient , although companies 
receive subsidies from the Latvian Environmental Protection Fund to 
collect and dispose of waste from environmentally harmful goods and 
products . water management infrastructures ( water supply and sewage 
collection and treatment ) are insufficiently developed and obsolete , 
its capacity is not economically justified , technologies used are 
energy costly and does not meet all environmental requirements . it 
restricts the development of the activity , in particular in remote 
regions of the country . access to water management infrastructure has a 
very significant impact on the development of utilities , public 
catering , health and the tourism industry . Latvia must determine the 
deadline for transposition of the internal market rules , but also 
ensure monitoring of the transposition of the directives on national 
administration and at political level . at 7 September 2005 Latvia had not notified 1.3 % of the transposition of EU directives ( or 0.5 % of the total number of directives ) . given that 99.5 % of the directives were transposed into the Latvian prescriptions as at 7 September 2005 , it fully confirms that the Lisbon objective is , at least , 98,5 % of the directives or a deficit of 1.5 % of directives . transposition and implementation of the Internal Market Directives depends directly on the establishment of a common monitoring system for transposition of EU legislation . as far as the current transposition of EU legislation is concerned , an effective database which would provide the opportunity to monitor the transposition process within a number of reference points , as well as in addition to other circumstances , is slowing down the transposition process and creating an EU internal market . the close staff of public administrations will reduce their capacity to ensure that the transposition process of EU directives is consistent and timely with the Latvian legal system . restrictions on the freedoms of the EU internal market were in most lost before the accession of Latvia to the EU , but obstacles to transactions crossing borders still exist . significant obstacles arise from existing operating permits and time-consuming administrative procedures requiring companies to receive additional money and time and have the worst impact on small and medium-sized enterprises . it is therefore necessary to analyse the validity and validity of existing systems of licensing and other restrictions , including those of liberal professions ( lawyers , notaries , accountants , architects , engineers and pharmacists ) in order to promote competitiveness in these sectors . in order to introduce harmonised and harmonised competition policy , Latvian competition standards in 2004 were harmonised in accordance with EU competition standards . in the case of obstacles to competition crossing borders or preventing potential distortions of competition , the Latvian competition authority has launched a competition council ‚Äî active cooperation with the European Commission and the competition authorities of the Member States of the ECB . the electricity market is gradually opening . as of 1 July 2004 , a qualified free consumer status threshold was set at 0,0 GWh . therefore , only households cannot choose to choose the supplier and the opening of the electricity market to up to 75 % . until now , none of the free customers exchanged electricity . in order to stimulate competition and encourage the entry of alternative suppliers , the functions of transmission and distribution of electricity are required to separate the functions of electricity generation and distribution from the functions of electricity generation and sale . the conditions for electricity supply structures are defined in the Electricity Market Act . the EU builds our common future and takes global commitments using only 1 % of its wealth per year . the focus of the delusions is to respond to the challenges posed by the world &apos;s citizens in the interests of a better life for our societies . the European Parliament is the only directly elected body of the European Parliament , representing you in the European Parliament , representing you . this part of our website will find information on how Parliament will organise its work through a system of different committees . Parliament has an active role to play in drafting legislation affecting the daily lives of its citizens , for example on environmental protection , consumer rights , equal opportunities , transport and the free movement of workers , capital , services and goods , the Parliament and the Council also have a joint mandate over the annual budget of the European Union . the European Parliament is composed of 736 members elected from 27 Member States of the enlarged European Union . since 1979 , MEPs have been elected by direct universal suffrage for five years . each Member State will decide on the form of elections , but they must comply with the same democratic basic rules : gender equality and secret ballot . in all Member States , 18 years of electoral age , except Austria , where it is 16 years . the European elections are already governed by a number of common principles : direct and general elections , proportional representation and five-year term of office . as a general rule , seats shall be distributed in proportion to the population of each Member State . each Member State shall have a specific number of seats ‚Äì most 99 and least 5 . equality between men and women : the role of women in the European Parliament is steadily increasing . it is a little more than a third of Parliament &apos;s members . members of the EP share their time between Brussels , Strasbourg and their constituency , in Brussels , they attend meetings of committees and political groups and plenary sessions in Strasbourg . in parallel , they must , of course , devote time to their constituency . members of the European Parliament shall be grouped together by common political views and not nationality . they shall use their mandate independently . since the power of Members of the European Parliament is increasing , they will have an impact on all citizens &apos; everyday lives : environment , consumer protection , transport and education , culture , health , etc . the new Statute of the Members of the European Parliament entered into force on 14 July 2009 , in the new Statute , in the new Statute , the working conditions of an MEP have been more transparent and will establish the same remuneration for all members of the EU budget . in the European Parliament , all the languages of the Community are equally important : all Parliament &apos;s documents will be published in all the official languages of the European Union ( EU ) , and every member of the EP has the right to speak in its own official language . what better way to ensure transparency and accessibility of Parliament &apos;s work ? multilingual multilingualism in European agreements reflects the cultural and linguistic diversity of the European Union . it also makes the European institutions more accessible and transparent to the public , which will help ensure the success of the EU democratic system . the European Parliament distinguishes its responsibility from other EU institutions to ensure a great deal of linguistic diversity . all EU citizens must be able to access them directly in their national language . and since every European citizen has the right to stand in elections to the European Parliament , it is unreasonable to require Members to have a perfect holding of a common language . the right of each member to read in his or her language , to follow debates and to speak explicitly , shall be explicitly laid down in Parliament &apos;s Rules of Procedure . in addition , the European Parliament , as legislator , must ensure the good linguistic quality of all legislation adopted in all official languages . furthermore , the provisions of the Treaty allow every European citizen to monitor the work of the Parliament , ask questions and receive answers in its language . the European Parliament , in its resolution of 9 October , stated that &amp; quot ; experience gained from previous European elections and referenda shows that they are more likely to take part in those who are aware of the issues related to the EU and are less likely to participate in the participation of citizens of less informed &amp; quot ; . on the eve of the European Parliament elections in October 2009 , the Council and the Commission adopted a joint declaration on Communicating Europe in Partnership with a view to highlighting the need for political preparedness at all levels of the EU institutions and the Member States at all levels of the EU . the main objective of the joint declaration is to provide citizens with fair and diverse information on the EU , so that they can be actively involved in the public debate on EU issues . with the Joint Declaration , the EU institutions were responsible for resolving problems with the Member States in the EU &apos;s communism in order to ensure communication with the greatest possible target group at the right levels . in this context , they expressed their desire to develop synergies with national , regional and local authorities and civil society representatives . although each Member State and each institution have its own communication strategy and its priorities , Parliament , the Council and the Commission agreed to establish a small number of common communication priorities for each year . in addition , the Commission calls on the other EU institutions at the beginning of each year to provide feedback to the other EU institutions on the implementation of the common communication priorities for the previous year . the European Union was created to end the frequent bloody wars between the neighbours , which became the Second World War . in 1950 , the European Coal and Steel Community ( ECSC ) will make the economic and political connection of European countries for a lasting lasting peace . six founding countries are Belgium , the Netherlands , Italy , Luxembourg , France and Germany . in the 1950s , there is a cold war between East and West . in Hungary , in 1956 , protests against communist regime are suppressed by Soviet tanks ; the next , 1957 , the Soviet Union will take a seat on the space race if it sends orbit to the first co-mate Sputnik-1 . in 1957 , the Treaty of Rome establishes the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , i.e. the ‚Äò common market ‚Äô . in the 1960s , &amp; quot ; youth culture &amp; quot ; is emerging , the Beatles and other bands attract enormous teenagers everywhere , encouraging the cultural revolution and the widening gap between generations . there are good times in the economy , partly because EU countries stop collecting customs duties . in addition , they impose joint control on food production , which will result in sufficient food and soon to produce surplus agricultural products . in May 1968 , in Paris , the famous student peace riots and the &apos; 68 generations &apos; will be associated at a later stage in society and in the behaviour of people . on 1 January 1973 , the number of members of the European Union will grow to nine , when the accession of Ireland , Denmark and the United Kingdom . a short but violent Arab war in October 1973 brings the energy crisis in Europe and economic problems . the last European right-wing dictatorships are falling in the area of Salazar &apos;s regime in 1974 , and in 1975 General Franco dies in Spain . within the framework of EU regional policy , the allocation of huge amounts of jobs and infrastructure development in poorer regions will be distributed . the European Parliament &apos;s influence in the EU &apos;s business is increasing , and citizens will be able to choose directly from Parliament in 1979 . in Europe and worldwide , the Polish trade union will rise to Solidarno≈õƒá and its leader Lech Walesa , when Gdansk is resting in the summer of 1980 . in 1981 , the EU becomes a member of Greece and five years later , Spain and Portugal will join . in 1987 the Single European Act will be signed . this agreement provides the basis for a comprehensive six-year programme aimed at addressing the EU &apos;s cross-border free trade problems and thus developing a common market . the political shock will bring the Berlin Wall down on 9 November 1989 and the reopening of the border between East and West Germany after 28 years of time . the collapse of Communism throughout Central and Eastern Europe strengthens the neighbourhoods of Europeans . in 1993 , the creation of a common market , &amp; quot ; four fundamental freedoms &amp; quot ; is a free movement of goods , services , people and money . in the 1990s , two new agreements are also concluded : the Treaty on European Union , namely the Treaty of Maastricht , and the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999 . citizens are increasingly concerned about protecting the environment , while looking for new opportunities for European security and defence . in 1995 , the EU will receive three new members , Austria , Finland and Sweden . the Schengen agreements concluded by the small town of Luxembourg will provide a gradual opportunity for people to travel without a passport at national borders . millions of young people go to other countries with support from the EU . communication will become easier and more people are using mobile phones and Internet . the new currency of many Europeans will be the euro . the political divide in Eastern and Western Europe will be declared definitively exceeded in 2004 , with the EU joining less than 10 new countries . many consider that Europe now has time to become its constitution , but it is far from easy to agree what it should be and debate on the future of Europe . the single currency will be able to compare prices in all the Member States that use it directly . transnational travel is easier , since the cost of money is no longer the cost and the effort . competition with the common market has helped to increase quality and lower prices . phone calls , Internet connection and air travel . the EU protects consumers against defective and unquality products , whether goods are purchased from home or from another country . the EU also sets the highest standards of food safety . EU citizens can live , work or retire in other EU countries . gradually , temporary restrictions on the free movement of labour in 12 Member States are eliminated . over two million young people have been studying or training in the EU &apos;s programmes , or in another European country . thanks to this , every student and other student , which are Erasmus , Leonardo and other cross-border partnerships , will know . the EU does not decide what school is learning , but seeks to ensure that the education and professional qualifications acquired in other EU countries are recognised without problems . good health of the environment is an important issue for the governments of Europeans and their governments . the EU is therefore at the forefront of the global environmental protection and combating climate change efforts . since pollution does not feel borders , the EU has been acting jointly for years . it is not surprising that Europe &apos;s rivers and beaches are cleaner , cars are polluting less and the strict rules on waste management . European hazardous waste cannot be transported to poor countries anymore . there are also strict EU rules to ensure the safety of chemicals used by businesses and the environment . the EU aims to make transport , industry , agriculture and tourism operational so that they do not destroy natural resources ‚Äì in other words , that development is sustainable . in order to halt climate change , the EU has agreed on strict measures to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 % by 2020 . energy is the cornerstone of long-term climate policy in the EU and the EU has set binding targets for wind , hydro- and solar energy and other clean renewable energy sources . in addition to combating climate change , it helps to promote the economy and secure more stable energy supply by reducing Europe &apos;s dependence on foreign oil and gas imports . the EU has already put in place an innovative emission trading system , which many energy-consuming companies can benefit from reducing energy consumption and penalising companies crossing the borders . the euro ( ‚Ç¨ ) is probably one of the EU &apos;s tangible achievements . the single currency is ( as at 2009 ) in 16 countries where more than two-thirds of the EU population lives . other countries will join if their economies are ready for this . all euro banknotes and coins can be used in all countries where the euro is inoperable . paper money is the same everywhere , but on the coins , there is a common design and the distinguishing sign of the country of origin . the euro is in the following countries : Austria , Belgium , Spain , the Netherlands , Ireland , Italy , Greece , Cyprus , Luxembourg , Malta , Portugal , France , Germany , Slovakia , Slovenia , Finland and the United Kingdom . our society is fairer and more effective than discriminating against other people because of their nationality , gender , disability , race or other specific characteristics . the EU therefore prohibits discrimination . in the 1950s , the first EU treaties included a clear rule , men and women must receive equal pay for equal work . it was a pioneer in the fight against women &apos;s rights , and today they form an integral part of EU policies . to combat cross-border crime and terrorism , EU countries have taken steps to ensure full cooperation between police and customs officials , migration agencies and courts . one practical measure is the European Arrest Warrant , which facilitates the transfer of suspected persons from the country where they are arrested , the country where their actions are to be investigated and prosecuted . EU countries also coordinate asylum policy and strengthen control at the EU &apos;s external borders . as EU citizens have the right to live in all Member States , their rights must be protected in all EU countries . national governments must ensure the uniform application of EU legislation and the enforceability of national judgments in other Member States . the EU has greatly facilitated cross-border legal issues such as marriage , separation , divorce and custody of children and the resolution of other civil disputes . new skills are needed and all we have to do is devote more time to learning . more information on the EU &apos;s employment and growth . the war between EU countries is unthinkable , thanks to the unity between countries over the past 50 years . given this success
